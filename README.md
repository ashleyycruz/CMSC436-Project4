# CMSC 436 Project 4 – Text Mining + Clustering

We turn 52 movie reviews into numbers and then group similar reviews together.

## How to run

```bash
python3 feature_vector.py    # Part 1 only: prints the feature vector
python3 tdm_matrix.py        # Parts 1 + 2: also builds the TDM
```

## Folder layout

```
data/                      the paragraphs + stop words given by the class
feature_vector.py          Part 1: cleans the text and builds the feature vector
tdm_matrix.py              Part 2: Builds the term document matrix
porter_stemmer.py          the class's Porter stemmer (algorithm unchanged)

## Part 1 – Feature vector (4 pts)

**Who:** Ashley
**Status:** Done
**Code:** `feature_vector.py`

Steps A–H: tokenize, remove punctuation/html tags, remove numbers, lowercase, remove stop words, Porter stemming, count word frequency per paragraph, keep words above threshold T.

Results (T = 10):

- 52 paragraphs, 9,985 words after cleaning, 3,399 unique stems
- Feature vector = stems that appear more than 10 times total → **161 words**
- Change `T` at the top of `feature_vector.py` to make the vector bigger or smaller

---

## Part 2a – Term Document Matrix (3 pts)

**Who:** Bella
**Status:** Done
**Code:** `tdm_matrix.py`

Build the TDM: 52 rows (paragraphs) × 161 columns (feature words). Each cell = how many times that word appears in that paragraph. Reuse `main()` from `feature_vector.py`.

Results:
   - Matrix dimensions: 52 paragraphs x 161 features
   - Full matrix saved to `tdm.csv`

**For Part 3:**
`from tdm_matrix import main as run_part2`, then
`paragraphs, stemmed, per_paragraph, feature_vector, matrix = run_part2()`
- `matrix` is a list of 52 lists, each with 161 counts
- rows = paragraphs, columns = features in `feature_vector` order.

## Part 2b – Explain steps A–H (2 pts)

**Who:** Bella
**Status:** In Progress

For each step A–H: what it's for, and what information gets lost by doing it.

---

## Part 3 – Clustering code (Kohonen WTA or FCAN)

**Who:** Benjamin
**Status:** Done
**Code:** `cluster.py` (needs numpy to run)

Run the clustering algorithm on the TDM to group similar paragraphs.
Groups the 52 paragraphs using Kohonen Winner-Take-All. Each cluster has a prototype and only the closest one moves toward each paragraph.

Results:

- 2 clusters: 31 paragraphs and 21 paragraphs
- Assignments saved to `cluster_assignments.csv`
  
---

## Part 3a – How many clusters/topics (2 pts)

**Who:** Benjamin
**Status:** Done
**Code:** `cluster.py`

Tried k = 2 to 6 and checked which k gives the same clusters across 10 random starts.

Answer: **2 clusters.** It is the most stable and extra clusters are mostly way smaller like 1 to 3 paragraphs. The two clusters overlap a fair bit as well.


---

## Part 3b – TDM dimensionality (2 pts)

**Who:** Name TBD
**Status:** Not started

What drives the size of the TDM, and how to reduce it.

---

## Part 3c – Results (2 pts)

**Who:** Name TBD
**Status:** Not started

Show the clusters and comment on what each one is about.

---

## Report + submission

**Who:** Name TBD
**Status:** Not started

Report PDF (answers to all parts + signed certification page) + this code, zipped as `GroupName_Project4.zip`.

---

## For the report

**Step H (from the assignment):** _"Provide the feature vector in your report."_

Paste this into the report under Part 1. The feature vector is every stemmed word that appears more than T = 10 times across all 52 paragraphs: **161 words**, sorted from most to least frequent. Words look cut off (`movi`, `charact`) because the Porter stemmer chops them down to their root.
